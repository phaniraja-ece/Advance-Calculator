# Advance-Calculator
It is a C# based Calculator which uses BigInteger so it is not limited to only 10³⁰⁸.

I would recommend you to manually compile.

To compile manually:

• Have .NET 10 SDK Installed
• Clone the project using git clone or download the compile.zip in releases
• Open the Terminal in the Folder
• Type dotnet publish -r win-x64 -c Release in the terminal
• And run the exe in /bin/Release/net10.0/win-x64/publish
